  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Camille Watson was staying with her sister and her sister\u2019s husband, Larry Thompson, when she dialed 911 after seeing a diaper rash on the couple\u2019s infant daughter and mistaking the rash for signs of abuse. In response, two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) arrived at Thompson\u2019s apartment building to investigate. The EMTs saw nothing amiss, and, unaware of Camille\u2019s 911 call, Thompson told the EMTs that no one in his home had called 911. He asked the EMTs to leave, and they did.</p>\n<p>Four police officers followed up to investigate the alleged child abuse and insisted on seeing Thompson\u2019s daughter. Thompson asked to speak to the officers\u2019 sergeant, and after being denied that request, asked whether the officers had a warrant (which they did not). Nevertheless, they physically tried to enter Thompson\u2019s home, and when Thompson attempted to block the doorway, the officers tackled and handcuffed him. He was arrested and taken to jail, where he spent two days. He was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration, and about three months later, the prosecution dropped the charges against him, stating that \u201cPeople are dismissing the case in the interest of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thompson filed a Section 1983 malicious prosecution claim against the police officers involved. A federal district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants on Thompson\u2019s malicious prosecution claim due to his failure to establish favorable termination of his criminal case, which is required under binding Second Circuit precedent. The appellate court affirmed.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Must a plaintiff who seeks to bring a Section 1983 action alleging unreasonable seizure pursuant to legal process show that the criminal proceeding against him \u201cformally ended in a manner not inconsistent with his innocence,\u201d or that the proceeding \u201cended in a manner that affirmatively indicates his innocence\u201d?</p>\n",
